## Prompt:

In 2009 one of the associate editors of Biostatistics, Roger Peng, outlined a new policy of [reproducibility](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014) for the journal. 

This triggered a response from one of the other associated editors, Niels Keiding, and subsequently a large part of volume 11, issue 3 of Biostatistics was dedicated to a discussion of issues of redproducibility. 


Read through 

- Roger Peng's [initial editorial](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014), 

- [Keiding's response](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq033),

- its five [commentaries](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/issue/11/3),  

- Roger Peng's [response to Keiding](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq032)

- and finally, Keiding's [response to the commentaries](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq034)

Don't worry about the number of papers listed - these papers are all very short and easy reads. 


Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    
    Peng first pointed out an issue that many scientific investigations cannot be fully replicated becasue of a lack of time or resources. As one of the editors of Biostatistics, Peng gave three dimentions for reproducibility, which are "Data,Code, and Reproducible". Peng also gave instructions and examples for authors who want to submit to Biostatistics.
    
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    
    Keiding believes the importance of reproducibility is not to get the same numerical results from the original data and the codes, but let other researchers to understand the substantive context and the strengths and weaknesses of the data.
    
    
    
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**.
    
     I found Norman E Breslow's proposal of providing with sample code and a test data set to reproduce the published results with a minimum amount of effort interesting. In real academic world, even a single paper may require tons of data and codes. It's a waste of time for each reader to reproduce the results by themselves using the same date and codes. What's important for the paper is the new concepts and new methods, not reanalyse the same data set.
    

    
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
    "Donoho claims—credibly—that reproducible research will have higher impact and is here seconded by Breslow" is the respond Keiding gave to Breslow.
    His major point in this commentary response is that we need sunstantive context or details for "reproducibility", not barely the data and codes.


    
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

I am dealing with 16 S rRNA sequencing data, therefore the metadata(data that describes the information of samples that generate the data) are of great importance. However, when constructing metadata, for convenience, people write abbreviations a lot, this causes issues because others who want to analyze the same data may not understand those information in the metadata,especially for those written by abbreviations. If I went back, I would make the metadata documentation more detailed.Or I will set another document to explain what's the more detailed information in the metadata.
